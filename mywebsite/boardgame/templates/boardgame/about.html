<h2>The Story Behind BoardGameMeet</h2>
<p><strong>BoardGameMeet</strong> was created by Darby Christy, a software development student at the University of Glasgow. Darby’s journey began when she moved to Glasgow and wanted to find a way to connect with her new community. Inspired by her own experience, Darby created an application that would bring board game enthusiasts together, making it easier for them to find game groups and participate in local events.</p>
